Deep below the bustling city streets and comforts of daily life lie the labyrinthine tunnels of older powers. The sacrifice required to maintain your demonic presence below is terrible and insatiable. To satisfy your hunger, take but a finger from each member that approaches the dark altar...

[DAY]

Your followers now begin to truly respect your dark will; they know what awaits them upon the altar. Feed now upon their worry and their tension. Grow your strength by toying with their emotions before the final moment. Their anticipation will become your power...

[DAY]

Your insidious power grows, hidden from lawful eyes. As your sway over the cultish masses increases, so do their numbers. Among their ranks now stand the unfaithful, the worried, the hesitant. Cull the weak now from your flock.
